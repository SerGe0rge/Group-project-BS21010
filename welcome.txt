Welcome to the group project 
The team has decided to create a program of experimental randomisation
The program will focus on reducing biased during trials by:
Asking the user to specify the sample size, sample type (control, treatment), time of treatment, time taken 
With these infomartion it will output a timetable of when the controls and treatments should take place 
Attempt to double-blind with code
